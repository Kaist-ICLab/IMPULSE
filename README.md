# EnPULSE
**EnPULSE (Enabling Platform for User Logging and Sensing Environment)** is a sensor data collection platform for mobile and wrist-worn wearable devices.

## Overview
EnPULSE consists of several core components, which can also be used individually.
Together, they support end-to-end sensor data collection.

**Note: Other components will be opened to the public after paper publication.**

### Android Library (`tracker-library`)
The core sensor tracking library capable of collecting various sensor data from mobile and Galaxy Watch devices. It includes 21 sensor types, with watch-specific sensors (`AccelerometerSensor`, `PPGSensor`, `HeartRateSensor`, `SkinTemperatureSensor`, `EDASensor`, `ECGSensor`) and phone-specific sensors (such as `StepSensor`).

### Mobile Tracker Application (`app-mobile-tracker`)
A mobile app for easy smartphone sensor data collection from Samsung devices. See the [Mobile Tracker README](app-mobile-tracker/README.md) for details.

### Wearable Tracker Application (`app-wearable-tracker`)
A smartwatch app for continuous biosignal sensing on Galaxy Watch devices. See the [Wearable Tracker README](app-wearable-tracker/README.md) for details.

### Backend
Locally-hosted Supabase-based backend component for storing sensor data and campaign configuration. The repository link is withheld for anonymous review.

### Dashboard
Web-based dashboard for campaign configuration, management, and data monitoring. The repository link is withheld for anonymous review.

### WebApp Platform (EnPULSE WebApps)
EnPULSE supports dynamic, remote-configured web applications (WebApps) that can be triggered dynamically from sensor state evaluations:
- **Dynamic Campaign Fetching**: WebApps are fetched dynamically from the `campaign_webapp` database table on campaign selection and synced locally to Couchbase storage on the mobile phone.
- **BLE Trigger Forwarding**: Trigger conditions are evaluated continuously on the Wearable Watch. When conditions are met, actions are forwarded to the Mobile Phone via BLE:
  - **Notification Action**: Displays a phone notification that launches the target WebApp on tap (e.g. for user intervention).
  - **Broadcast Action**: Dispatches local Android broadcasts (`sendBroadcast`) on the phone with customizable extras payload to interact with 3rd-party local phone applications.

## Installation & Setup

## For Developers: Building from Source

### Required Configuration

#### 1. Copy `local.properties.example`
Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` in the project root and configure your local Android SDK directory and Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp local.properties.example local.properties
```

#### 2. Download Samsung Health Sensor/Data SDK
The Samsung Health SDKs are required for collecting real-time biosignals from Galaxy Watch devices.

1. Download the Samsung Health [Sensor SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/health/data/overview.html#SDK-download) and [Data SDK](https://developer.samsung.com/health/data/overview.html#SDK-download) (requires a Samsung account).
2. Rename the downloaded `.aar` files to `samsung-health-sensor-api.aar` and `samsung-health-data-api.aar`.
3. Place the `.aar` files into the `samsung-health-sensor-api/` and `samsung-health-data-api/` directories respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Samsung Health Developer Mode Requirement:**
> To build and test Samsung Health data access locally without an approved Partner license, you **MUST** enable Developer Mode on your testing device:
> 1. Open the **Samsung Health** app on your phone.
> 2. Go to **Settings** -> **About Samsung Health** (Settings page -> Scroll to the bottom).
> 3. Tap the **Version** line 10 times consecutively.
> 4. You will see a toast confirming developer mode has been enabled.
> 5. Without this, you will encounter `AuthorizationException (Error 2003: Could not get policy)` during permission requests.

#### 3. Add `google-services.json` (Firebase Configuration)
Because `google-services.json` is untracked by Git for security, you must provide your own Firebase project configuration when building from source:

1. Create or open a project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add an Android App registered with package name `kaist.iclab.trackerSystem` (refer to [google-services.json.example](app-mobile-tracker/google-services.json.example) for template structure).
3. Download `google-services.json` and place it inside the `app-mobile-tracker/` directory.
4. (Optional) Enable Google Sign-In under Firebase Authentication settings.
