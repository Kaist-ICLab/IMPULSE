# Tracker Library

Core Android library of EnPULSE for collecting, storing, and synchronizing
sensor data from smartphones and Galaxy Watch devices. The library exposes a
uniform `Sensor` interface that is implemented by each modality, along with a
`BackgroundController` foreground service that drives the lifecycle of any
combination of sensors at runtime.

## Sensor Modalities

Sensors live under `src/main/java/kaist/iclab/tracker/sensor/` and are grouped
by package according to the device that hosts them. The **Device** column
below records where each sensor actually runs:

- **Phone** &mdash; any Android smartphone.
- **Watch** &mdash; any WearOS smartwatch
- **Samsung Phone** &mdash; Samsung smartphone with Samsung Health installed.
- **Galaxy Watch** &mdash; Wear OS Galaxy Watch (model gates noted in the description).
